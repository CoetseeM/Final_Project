# London Crime and the Influences of Socio-economic Factors

This was my final project for my MSc Data Science programme

Abstract

Amidst increasing urbanisation and the connection between higher population
densities and increased crime rates, it becomes imperative for governments to employ
effective interventions to protect the people in its cities. To address the gap in
previous literature, this project looked to assess the effectiveness of four open source
socio-economic factors in predicting crime in London using data science techniques.
Data analysis was conducted using statistical methods and visualisations in Python to
identify spacio-temporal crime trends in London. Additionally, machine learning
techniques were used to run regression models on the data, such as the Random Forest
Regressor, to identify the effectiveness of using population density per square
kilometer, median income, unemployment and the percentage of people earning under
the London Living Wage in predicting overall crime in London. Crime rates in London
were found to have strong spacio-temporal elements for both overall crime and
individual major crime types such as theft and violence against the person. The
socio-economic factors used to predict overall crime rates in London were all shown to
influence London crime rates to some degree, particularly population density. This
study provided a valuable foundation for understanding socio-economic factors that
influence crime in London using machine learning, as well as yearly, monthly, and area 
trends. Further research could look at the influence that other socio-economic factors 
play on the crime rate in London and on specific crime types rather than overall crime.

Understanding the relationships between socio-economic factors and the spacio-temporal
trends in crime rate in London is crucial for policymakers. This research provided valuable
insights that can inform targeted interventions and policies aimed at reducing crime rates
in specific London boroughs. Policymakers can use this information to allocate resources
effectively and begin to address factors that influence crime, as well as providing
prevention strategies at varying times of the year based on the temporal findings.

Limitations and Future Research
While this study offers valuable insights, there were limitations particularly regarding data
sources and the nature of reported crimes. The study aimed to explore various
socio-economic factors influencing crime rates in London through the use of open source
data. However, not all desired variables were available, leading to the use of substitutes
that might not provide a comprehensive representation of the underlying dynamics. For
instance, while median income was used as a substitute for income inequality, it may not
capture the full spectrum of income disparities within boroughs. Another limitation in
this project and crime analysis in general, is the issue of under reporting. Police data,
which forms the basis of many crime analyses, often fails to capture the true extent of
crime due to various factors. These factors include, poor police-community relationships,
lack of confidence in the justice system and shame around reporting of certain crimes
(Buil-Gil, Moretti and Langton, 2021).

This research contributes to the understanding of crime trends in London, and provides a
foundation for future investigations into the multifaceted relationship between
socioeconomic factors and crime in London. However, the complex interplay of socioeconomic
and cultural factors needs to be further explored to fully comprehend the evolving patterns
of crime in London compared to other cities and countries. This could help to inform
effective crime prevention and intervention strategies.

Future Improvements:
-Investigate the influence that socio-economic factors play on specific crime types by 
borough to explore the differences in crime types.
-Explore additional socio-economic variables, such as education levels and income inequality,
to further enhance understanding of crime trends in London.
-Employ and evalaute neural networks model in predicting crime in London.
